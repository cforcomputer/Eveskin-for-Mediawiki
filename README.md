# Eveskin-for-Mediawiki
This is a modified version of the MonoBook skin for wikimedia whose stylesheet has been edited to look like CCP's late wiki EVElopedia. 

Assets used in this skin are property of CCP games and should not be used for commercial use without permission.

Install by copying the folder into the \htdocs\*yourwikiname*\skins directory. Replace the existing MonoBook skin and clear your browser cache, or your development server should update automatically. Make sure the active skin in LocalSettings.php is changed accordingly.
